Create the Cleaned_Tourism Table
Part 1
1. If necessary, redefine the cr library. Read the cr.tourism table and create the cr.cleaned_tourism table.
2. Remove the columns _1995 through _2013.
3. Create the Country_Name and Tourism_Type columns from values in the Country column. Valid values for Tourism_Type are Inbound tourism and Outbound tourism. Remove rows that contain this labeling information and no other data.
Part 2
4. In the Series column, convert values to uppercase and convert ".." to missing a character value.
5. Determine the conversion type (Mn or Thousands) that will be used to calculate values for the new Y2014 column. Hint: You might want to create a new column with this information.
6. In the _2014 column, change the data not available (values of "..") to a single period.
Part 3
7. Create the Y2014 column by explicitly converting character values in _2014 to numeric and multiplying by the conversion type (millions or thousands) that is found in the Country column or new column, if you created one.
8. Create the new Category column from values in the Country column and change the original values to the following valid values:
• Arrivals
• Departures
• Passenger Transport - US$
• Tourism expenditure in other countries - US$
• Tourism expenditure in the country – US$
• Travel - US$
9. Permanently format Y2014 with the COMMA format.
10. Include only Country_Name, Tourism_Type, Category, Series, and Y2014 in the output table.
Create the Final_Tourism Table
1. Create a format for the Continent column that labels continent IDs with the corresponding continent names:
1 = North America
2 = South America
3 = Europe
4 = Africa
5 = Asia
6 = Oceania
7 = Antarctica
2. Merge the cleaned_tourism table with a sorted version of country_info to create the final_tourism table. Include only matches in the output table. Use the new format to format Continent.

Create the NoCountryFound Table
Create the NoCountryFound table that has a list of countries from Cleaned_Tourism that are not found in the country_info table. This table should have only one row for each country.
